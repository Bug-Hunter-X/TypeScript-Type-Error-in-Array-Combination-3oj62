# TypeScript Type Error in Array Combination

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript when combining arrays of different types.  The `combine` function is designed to merge two number arrays. However, an error occurs if one of the arrays contains an element of a different type (in this case, a string).  The solution involves type checking or type assertion to ensure type consistency.

## Bug
The original code attempts to combine two arrays, but the second array contains a string element. This violates the type safety enforced by TypeScript, resulting in a compilation error.

## Solution
The solution involves refining type handling either by ensuring type consistency before combining or using type assertion.
